# Pandoc Template

This is a minimal [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) config and templates that I've used when working on [Production Ready GraphQL](https://book.productionreadygraphql.com). It generates both a PDF and an EPUB book from markdown found in the `book` folder.

## Usage

Generating the book artifacts is as simple as using the `generate` script:

```
./script/generate
```

## Documentation

The [Pandoc manual](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) is your friend!
